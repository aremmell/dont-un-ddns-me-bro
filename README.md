# namecheap-ddns

A simple, lightweight, portable CLI-based Python script that updates Dynamic DNS records with [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com). You don’t even need to know your public IP address.

`nc-ddns.py` was designed with `cron` and similar scheduled and/or event-triggered system daemons in mind. It can just as easily be run manually whenever you like–but that’s not ideal for DDNS.
